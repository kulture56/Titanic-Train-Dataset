 # Titanic-Train-Dataset
**Overview**
This project focuses on exploring and cleaning the Titanic train dataset, providing a foundational data analysis exercise often used in data science. The dataset includes various attributes of Titanic passengers, such as their age, gender, class, and survival status. The primary objective of this project is to understand data cleaning processes and perform basic feature engineering.

**Key Inquiries and Solutions**
1) What data cleaning steps were necessary for this dataset?

   Answer: Missing values were handled, particularly in columns like Age and Cabin. The dataset was prepared for analysis by imputing values 
   where needed and dropping irrelevant features.
   
2) How was feature engineering applied to improve the dataset?

   Answer: A new column was engineered using existing data to help improve model predictions. This involved combining relevant columns or 
   creating new derived features, like categorizing passengers by age groups.
   
3) What insights can be drawn from the cleaned dataset?

   Answer: After cleaning and exploring the dataset, we were able to observe trends related to survival rates across different passenger 
   classes, gender, and ticket prices. This provides insight into which groups were more likely to survive.
